# MCP-rails deep audit (2026-06-08)

User ask: full manual test of ALL 19 MCP tools; find skills still doing MD-logic
instead of MCP orchestration (esp. the create-spec phase chain "research → … →
finalize"); honest answer on whether the full spec lifecycle (generate e2e / edit /
set statuses / close tasks / run tests / trace to a real test-run без наёба) is
actually covered. Prior (advisor): every "looks done" this session turned out
partially dead/fake — hunt for gaps, an all-green audit is suspicious.

## 1. All 19 MCP tools — value-tested against ground truth (not just ok:true)

Driven through the REAL bundle (`server.bundle.mjs`), values cross-checked against
`spec-verdict` / `ls .specs` / the fresh NDJSON:

| Tool | Result | Ground-truth check |
|---|---|---|
| get_node `FR-39` | ok, line 676 | matches FR.md:676 ✓ |
| get_trace `FR-39` | ok, scen=7, code_impl=3, **acs=0** | scen matches find_by_tags=7 ✓; **acs=0 SUSPECT — AC-39.1/2/3 exist** 🟡 |
| find_refs `FR-39` | ok, references present | ✓ |
| find_by_tags `@FR-39` | 7 scenarios | = the 7 @FR-39 scenarios ✓ |
| search `FR-39` | hits=1 | id/title substring (FR-39 node) — plausible ✓ |
| conformance_check | 1297 findings | corpus-wide (47 specs) — not scoped (by design) |
| find_orphans | 40 | corpus-wide |
| get_coverage_summary | specs=2 | "grouped by source directory" (.specs + tests/features?) — VERIFY 🟡 |
| get_coverage `{}` | scenarios:1535 passed:135 **not_run:1399** | corpus-wide → **MISLEADING per-spec** 🔴 FIXED |
| get_coverage `{spec}` | scenarios:164 passed:135 not_run:28 skipped:1 | = spec-verdict numbers ✓ (after fix) |
| get_spec_status `{spec}` | PARTIAL, last_run passed:135/skipped:1 | matches reality ✓ |
| validate_anchor `fr-39` | resolves=true | ✓ |
| list_specs | 47 | matches `ls -d .specs/*` ✓ |
| list_spec_docs `{spec}` | 26 docs | ✓ |
| read_spec_doc `FR.md` | 76761 bytes | ✓ |
| get_test_result `…_114` | PASSED | matches NDJSON ✓ |
| list_phase_tasks `Phase 17…` | 11 tasks | non-empty ✓ (count vs 9 expected — verify) |
| propose_spec_change (no-op) | **ok=false findings=0** | edge: no-op/identical change refusal unclear 🟡 |
| apply_spec_change | ok (live write-path test) | created+mutated throwaway through door ✓ |
| create_spec | ok (live write-path test) | scaffolded throwaway through door ✓ |

**Note:** propose/apply_spec_change REQUIRE a `reason` arg (zod) — an earlier smoke
that omitted it failed on validation, not on the doc — so re-test with `reason`.

## 2. Honesty gate (trace → test-run без наёба) — PROVEN two-sided on real v4 data

`get_coverage` per-task `verified_status` against the fresh real NDJSON:
- `p17-mutation-surface` → **DONE** (mapped scenario `_114` really PASSED).
- `p17-carveout-list` → **DONE** (`_133` PASSED).
- `verify-phase2-green` / `marksman-installer` → **IN_PROGRESS** (mapped scenarios
  `_15/_16` undefined/not_run → NOT falsely marked verified).

So a DONE task with a real passing scenario reads green; a task whose scenario is
undefined does NOT — the task→DoneWhen(`SPECGEN004_NN`)→scenario(@FR tag)→tested-by
edge→NDJSON lastResult→bucket→verified_status chain holds end-to-end, no fake.

## 3. Status-setting under enforce — NOT a hole (verified)

`.progress.json` is excluded from the mutation door (single-writer rule); it is
written by `spec-status.ts -ConfirmStop` (engine CLI, ENGINE_CLI carve-out → ALLOWED
under enforce), orchestrated by create-spec phase docs. TASKS.md `Status:` edits go
via `apply_spec_change`. Both reachable under enforce.

## GAPS FOUND

- 🔴 **G1 (FIXED 9658d06):** `get_coverage` had no `spec` param → always corpus-wide
  (1399 not_run) → misleading per-spec. Added optional `spec` scoping.
- 🔴 **G2:** create-spec phase docs (phase1, phase1.5, phase3, phase3plus) READ
  `.specs/{slug}/JIRA_SOURCE.md` (existence check + read) RAW — under enforce: denied.
  Migrate → `list_spec_docs` (existence) + `read_spec_doc` (read).
- 🔴 **G3:** phase3plus_audit-overview CREATES `.specs/{feature}/AUDIT_REPORT.md` via
  raw Write — under enforce: denied. Migrate → `apply_spec_change` ({content}).
- ✅ **G4 — FALSE POSITIVE (RESOLVED 2026-06-08):** `get_trace FR-39` does NOT return acs=0.
  The covers edges FR-39→AC-39.1/2/3 ARE in the live graph (dumped via `buildGraphFromCwd`),
  and the SOURCE handler returns them under the field `acceptance_criteria` (length 3) — the
  audit measured a non-existent `acs` key. No parser bug. (acs=0 was a stale-bundle/wrong-field
  measurement artifact.)
- ✅ **G5 — FALSE POSITIVE (RESOLVED 2026-06-08):** `propose_spec_change` requires
  `reason: z.string()` (CHANGE_SHAPE:1005). The "ok=false findings=0" smoke OMITTED `reason`
  → zod-schema reject envelope (no `findings`), not a handler refusal. With `reason` passed,
  a no-op identical `old_string` returns a CLEAR finding ("old_string is not unique (N
  occurrences) — pass replace_all or a longer anchor"). Refusal path is correct.
- ✅ **G6 — FALSE POSITIVE (RESOLVED 2026-06-08):** `get_coverage_summary` returns **54
  specs** grouped by slug (verified live: answer-simple/architecture-decision-builder/…),
  not 2. The earlier specs=2 was a stale-bundle reading.

> **G4/G5/G6 cluster lesson (verify-against-real-artifact):** all three "tool gaps" were
> MEASUREMENT artifacts (stale `server.bundle.mjs` at audit time + a wrong field name `acs`
> + an omitted required `reason`), not code defects. Re-driven through the SOURCE handlers
> (`buildToolRegistry(() => buildGraphFromCwd())`) they are all correct. The two REAL tool
> bugs (find_refs NODE_NOT_FOUND, list_specs nested collapse) plus G1 get_coverage scoping
> were genuine and are fixed. **P19-2 closed: no remaining MCP tool defect.**

## NOT yet covered (honest)

- Full GENERATIVE lifecycle by a LIVE agent under enforce (create→fill all phases→
  CHK/decisions→tasks→run tests→trace→verdict GREEN) end-to-end in ONE agent run.
  Done piecemeal: create_spec ✓, apply_spec_change ✓, read ✓, status reachable ✓,
  honesty gate ✓ — but not one continuous agent-driven build.
- Research skills (`research-workflow`, `architecture-research-workflow`) + the rest
  of the phase docs full MCP-rails refactor (only phase2 fully migrated before this).
- get_coverage spec-scoping: regression test + `spec-graph-query` skill wiring to
  pass `spec`.

## Deep gap-hunt (34-agent adversarial workflow, wf_03852f29) — 20 CONFIRMED

The manual pass found 6; the user said "мало найдено". A 7-area parallel finder +
per-finding adversarial verify (default-refuted) found **27 candidates → 20 confirmed**.

**HIGH:**
- 🔧 FIXED (dbc8241) `find_refs` returned ok:true on a NON-EXISTENT id (fake-positive
  "nothing references this") — now NODE_NOT_FOUND like siblings.
- 🔧 FIXED (dbc8241) `list_specs` regex collapsed nested specs (`backlog/<name>`→`backlog`)
  → 5+ nested specs invisible — now specOf full path + artifact-subdir filter.
- 🔴 No MCP path for BINARY ATTACHMENTS (`phase2` Step 5c Jira multimodal verify reads
  `.specs/<slug>/attachments/<file>` via raw Read; read_spec_doc filters to md/feature)
  → needs a `read_attachment` MCP tool or an attachments carve-out.
- 🔴 `architecture-decision-builder` reads `ARCHITECTURE/AXIS-*.md` raw (SKILL.md:86);
  read_spec_doc can't reach spec SUBDIRECTORIES (top-level basename only) → enforce blocks.
- 🔴 `variant-matrix-build` mutates ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA/{slug}.feature/TASKS via raw
  Write/Edit (SKILL.md) — NOT migrated to apply_spec_change (sibling chk-matrix is).
- 🔴 `spec-review` Step 1 `ls -t .specs/*/.progress.json` (raw ls) → use list_spec_docs.
- 🔴 `get_coverage` never passes `testQualityByTask` → can't cap DONE with weak/fake test.

**MEDIUM:** create-spec SKILL:69 raw Read of .progress.json; arch-research-workflow
writes stage files 1-7 raw to `.architecture-research/`; arch-decision writes
COMPLETENESS.md/QUEUE.json raw; arch-review-loop edits .specs docs raw; spec-status
Step 5b computes coverage + raw grep + sub-agent raw-read (3); spec-review Step 4
Edit not apply_spec_change; `.architecture-research/` subdir has NO mutation-door path
(MUTABLE_DOC_RE top-level only); **FR-35a test-quality gate INERT end-to-end** —
`test_quality_gate_stop.ts` never writes `.test-quality.json` AND spec-verdict never
reads testQualityByTask → the "weak test caps DONE/GREEN" honesty mechanism is dead
(cluster with the get_coverage HIGH).

**LOW:** `DUPLICATE_DEFINITION` finding code declared but never produced
(conformance.ts:361-376 dead `idCount`; test asserts a non-existent contract).

**Cross-cutting themes:** (1) the mutation/read door is TOP-LEVEL-DOC only — spec
SUBDIRECTORIES (ARCHITECTURE/, attachments/, .architecture-research/) have no MCP path,
so every skill using them breaks under enforce; (2) the test-QUALITY honesty layer is
wired in code but dead end-to-end (no producer, no consumer); (3) several authoring
skills (variant-matrix, spec-review, spec-status, arch-*) were never migrated off raw
Read/Write/ls — only the 4-5 from the first slice were.
