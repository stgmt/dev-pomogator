# Finding: can Stryker mutation-test BDD (cucumber) scenarios, and can BDD replace the vitest mutation surface?

**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Trigger:** owner request — "make Stryker track BDD tests, default for all users, automate hard at all levels." Motivated by the BDD-migration finding that `detect-invariant-candidates-unit.test.ts` must stay vitest *because Stryker's `--related` traces vitest, not cucumber* (so BDD-only-covered code gets no mutation protection).

## ⚠️ UPDATE 2026-06-20 (W1) — the official cucumber-runner SUPERSEDES the PoC conclusion below

The PoC (command-runner) conclusion ("BDD weak ~20%, slow 2.5h, cannot replace vitest") was **a measurement artifact**. Re-run with the OFFICIAL `@stryker-mutator/cucumber-runner` + `coverageAnalysis:'perTest'` + `concurrency:'100%'` on the SAME file [cmd:npx stryker run stryker.bdd.config.mjs → reports/mutation-bdd/mutation.json]:

| Metric | PoC (command-runner) | **Official cucumber-runner (perTest, 24 cores)** |
|---|---|---|
| Time (788 mutants) | ~2.5h (serial) | **13 min** (~11× faster; ignoreStatic would cut more — 331 static = 67% of time) |
| Mutation score | "~20%" (first-20 sample, exit-code-only) | **79.25%** (killed 568, survived 10, **noCoverage 139**, timeout 1, runtimeErr 23) |
| Of COVERED mutants | — | **~98% killed** (568 / 579) |

**Corrected conclusions:**
1. **The BDD scenarios are NOT coarse/weak.** Where a scenario reaches the code, it kills ~98% of mutants — TIGHTER than vitest's ~52% on this file. The PoC's "20%" was the command-runner (no per-test coverage, exit-code only) sampling the first ~20 mutants (unrepresentative static regex consts).
2. **The real weakness is COVERAGE GAPS, not assertion granularity.** 139 NoCoverage mutants sit in branches the 6 `@feature7` scenarios never exercise — Python `for-in` detection (L120), return-type branches (L80-82), composition-chains. So **W4's fix is to ADD scenarios for the uncovered branches**, NOT to rewrite `.includes`→`.toEqual` (the assertions are already tight).
3. **Speed is solved by the runner + parallelism**, not by narrowing — exactly the owner's instinct. cucumber-runner loaded the tsx step-defs fine (`testRunnerNodeArgs:['--import','tsx']`); dry-run 6 scenarios in 12s.
4. `detect-invariant-candidates-unit.test.ts` could in principle move to BDD once the 139-gap is closed — but **not urgent**; revisit at L1, do not blind-delete.

### W4 action — the SPECIFIC missing scenarios (from reading the NoCoverage lines)

The 139 NoCoverage mutants cluster in three branches the 6 `@feature7` scenarios never exercise
[ref:.claude/skills/strong-tests/scripts/detect-invariant-candidates.ts]:
1. **`suggestInvariants` Dict/Map branch** [ref:detect-invariant-candidates.ts:80] — a function whose
   returnType matches `dict|Map|Dict` → invariants `coverage`+`no-leak`. No scenario passes a Map-returning function.
2. **`suggestInvariants` Iterator/Iterable branch** [ref:detect-invariant-candidates.ts:81] → `idempotence`+`monotonicity`.
3. **`nestedLoopCount` Python `for-in`** [ref:detect-invariant-candidates.ts:120] + **Python indent-based
   `findFunctionEndLine`** [ref:detect-invariant-candidates.ts:148] — a Python function with nested
   `for … in …` loops → `nxm-overlap`. The existing Python scenario (TESTQUAL001_07) only tests suppression.

So W4 = author ONE scenario per branch (in-process `scan()` + `suggestInvariants` assertions, the tight
style already proven at ~98% kill), then re-run `npm run mutation:bdd` and confirm the NoCoverage count
(and the score) climbs. NOT "rewrite `.includes`→`.toEqual`" — the assertions are already tight.

### W4 RESULT — full re-measure after the 3 added scenarios (2026-06-20)

Re-ran the full file after adding TESTQUAL001_34/35/36 [cmd:npm run mutation:bdd → reports/mutation-bdd/mutation.json; host, 14m46s]:

| Metric | W1 (6 scenarios) | **W4 (+3 coverage scenarios)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Total mutation score** | 79.25% (→80.87% w/ id fix) | **82.82%** |
| **Of COVERED mutants** | ~98% | **94.88%** |
| NoCoverage (the coverage gap) | **139** | **91** (↓48 — the 3 scenarios closed ~48 uncovered mutants) |
| killed / timeout / survived / errors | 568 / 1 / 10 / 23 | **592 / 1 / 32 / 25** |

**Conclusions confirmed by real numbers:**
1. **Target massively exceeded.** The ≥45% goal (FR-4 hypothesis) is met at **82.82% total** — and the hypothesis "BDD is weak" is refuted: covered-score **94.88%** means where a scenario reaches the code it kills ~95% of mutants.
2. **The diagnosis was right.** Adding scenarios for uncovered branches (not rewriting assertions) is what moved the needle — NoCoverage fell 139→91 and total score rose ~3.5pts. The remaining 91 NoCoverage are deeper branches (further coverage work, not assertion tightening).
3. **The 32 survivors** are the next coverage/assertion targets (e.g. `Math.min`↔`Math.max` and `±1` arithmetic at L160 fallbackOffset — a real off-by-one branch a future scenario should pin). The strong-tests §6.5 breadth rule (a scenario per branch) is the mechanism to drive these down.
4. **Speed solved on the host too** — 14m46s for 741 mutants without Docker; perTest + 100% concurrency is the lever, exactly as designed.

Everything below is the SUPERSEDED PoC record (kept for history).

## What was built (proof-of-concept)

- `stryker.bdd.config.mjs` — Stryker's built-in **`command` test runner** (no plugin; `@stryker-mutator/core` ships it) running cucumber via `cucumber.bdd-mutation.json`, `coverageAnalysis: 'off'`, `concurrency: 1` (command writes a fixed temp path → parallel runs would race it → fake-green kills).
- `cucumber.bdd-mutation.json` — scoped to `strong-tests.feature` `@feature7` (the 6 detect-invariant behavioural scenarios), **throwaway `message:` format** (clobber-safe — never touches the canonical `.last-test-run.ndjson`).
- Target: `.claude/skills/strong-tests/scripts/detect-invariant-candidates.ts` — the SAME file `stryker.config.mjs` mutation-tests via **vitest** (~49-52% kill), so the kill-rate delta is apples-to-apples.
- Runs on the **host** (cucumber does NOT load `tests/setup/ensure-docker.ts` — that guards vitest only; cucumber has run on host all session). Stryker sandboxes the project copy, so real `.specs` is safe.

## Measured result (decisive)

| Dimension | BDD (cucumber, command runner) | vitest twin (same file) |
|---|---|---|
| **Kill rate** | **~20%** (at 20/741 mutants: 16 survived, 4 killed) | **~49-52%** |
| **Speed** | **~8s/run × 741 mutants ≈ 2.5 h for ONE file** | minutes (perTest coverage) |
| Plumbing | ✅ works — cucumber exit code kills mutants | ✅ |

**Plumbing works. The premise does not.** "Stryker *can* run BDD" ≠ "BDD *can replace* the vitest mutation surface":

1. **BDD kills < half what vitest kills.** Coarse behavioural scenarios (6 paths) don't reach the file's 12+ regex heuristics / return-type alternations the way 30+ fine-grained `scan()` unit tests do. Retiring the vitest twin would *lower* mutation coverage from ~52% → ~20%.
2. **BDD mutation is fundamentally slow, and NOT fixable by import-scoping.** Scoping the cucumber `import` from 107 step-def files to the 2 needed files changed runtime **8.0s → 6.9s** (negligible). The cost is **scenario execution** — the scenarios spawn `detect-invariant-candidates.ts` as a tsx subprocess (~1s each), not step-def compilation. A default-on BDD mutation gate across the codebase would be **days**.

## Implication for the L1 gate-switch (delete vitest twins)

**Do NOT blindly delete vitest twins.** Mutation-surface tests (e.g. `detect-invariant-candidates-unit.test.ts`) and the Stryker `mutate` targets stay vitest — BDD cannot protect them. This is the **3b "keep-as-scratch" bucket** in the rollout memory.

## Realistic options (owner decision — the literal "default-on, automate-hard" form is ruled out by the data)

1. **Opt-in scoped tool** — `npm run mutation:bdd -- <file> <@featureN>` to check "do my BDD scenarios kill mutants in this file" on demand. Cheap, honest, but not "default for everyone".
2. **Speed up first** — only viable by rewriting the scenarios' step-defs to call the code **in-process** (not spawn) — but that changes what the scenarios test (CLI/hook behaviour → unit behaviour). Large effort, semantic change.
3. **Hybrid (recommended)** — vitest stays the primary, fast mutation surface where it's strong; add a **scoped BDD mutation check only for production code that has NO vitest test** (the exact gap that motivated the request). Closes "BDD-only code is now mutation-checked" without degrading what works, and without pretending to a days-long default gate.

## Artifacts

- `stryker.bdd.config.mjs`, `cucumber.bdd-mutation.json` (PoC — host run)
- Experiment log: `.dev-pomogator/.tmp/stryker-bdd.out` (stopped at 20/741 — trend decisive)
